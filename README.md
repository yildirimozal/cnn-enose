This project provides 1D Convolutional neural network (CNN) application for the recognition of chemical volatiles.




We use three datasets obtained with e-nose detection systems in realistic environments.

The first data set is UMA. In this data set, there are 69 samples belonging to seven different substances. For full dataset please visit: http://mapir.uma.es/mapirwebsite/index.php/people/109-javier-gonzalez-monroy

Four different classes were considered for this dataset. Commercial alcohols (Negrita Rum, Larios and Gordon Gin, and Cointreau) were considered as a single class, and the other classes were acetone, butane, and ethanol. Four sensor outputs (TGS-2600, TGS-2602, TGS-2611 and TGS-2620) were used for the odor data of each substance in the data set for the study. 

We organized this dataset as UMAX.csv (time-series) and UMAY.csv (labels). 
UMAX.csv contains 69 (samples) x 1042 (time steps) x 4 (feature) 

Second dataset is UCI-1. The UCI-1 data set was derived from a system designed to test gas sensors in realistic environments. You can find full dataset in: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+array+exposed+to+turbulent+gas+mixtures

Two classes were created from the mixtures in the data set: first, mixtures of ethylene and methane (Et + Me), and second, mixtures of ethylene and carbon monoxide (Et + CO). 

We organized this dataset as UC1X.csv (time-series) and UC1Y.csv (labels). 
UC1.csv contains 180 (samples) x 2970 (time steps) x 8 (feature)
